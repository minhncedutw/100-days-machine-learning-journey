## Day 1 - 2018/11/06: What is QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNING?
> QUANTUM COMPUTING(QC) allows for calculation speed millions of times faster than current binary technology. So with Quantum Computing, current Machine Learning algorithm can be computed in a fraction of the time it takes now. Therefore, we can build much LARGER and COPLEX algorithm/neural-networks and compute them in the same amount of time current algorithms take place.

**Quantum Machine Learning(QML):** is attemptions to recast Machine Learning problems in the form of quantum algorithm to be run on quantum computers.

**How to combine ML and QC?**

There are 4 approaches:
    - CC:
    - CQ:
    - QC:
    - QQ:
