## Day 1 - 2018/11/06: What is QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNING?
> QUANTUM COMPUTING(QC) allows for calculation speed millions of times faster than current binary technology. So with Quantum Computing, current Machine Learning algorithm can be computed in a fraction of the time it takes now. Therefore, we can build much LARGER and COPLEX algorithm/neural-networks and compute them in the same amount of time current algorithms take place.

**Quantum Machine Learning(QML):** is attemptions to recast Machine Learning problems in the form of quantum algorithm to be run on quantum computers.

**How to combine ML and QC?**

There are 4 approaches:
    - CC:
    - CQ:
    - QC:
    - QQ:

**How to program QML?**
- Firstly, we have to have Quantum simulator.
- Create quantum algorithm then run on simulator.

**What is QML programming languague?** 
Cirq - a software toolkit that lets developers create algorithms without needing a background in quantum physics - initiated by Google.

## Day 2 - 2018/11/07: What is META LEARNING in Machine Learning?
> Traditional paradigm in ML need huge dataset to train model for specific task. Obviously, it is very far from how human leverages past experiences to learn very quickly new task from only a handset of examples. It is because human **_learns to learn_**.

**WHAT is Meta Learning?** This is no specific/standard definition for Meta Learning yet. In short, Meta Learning is to learn the learning process(or how to quickly learn some tasks from a tiny set of examples). 

**HOW to do Meta Learning?** 

There are some approaches:
    - recurrent models
    - meta-optimization
    - metric learning

Below is how we learn meta-parameters
