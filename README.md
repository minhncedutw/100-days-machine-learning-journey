1. CNN
    - Classification: 2D, 3D
    - Regression
    - Differentiation
    - Graph CNN
1. RNN
1. Reinforcement Learning
1. Meta learning
1. Quantum Machine Learning

## Day 1 - 2018/12/11: Point Cloud Classification-Segmentation algorithms

> A point cloud is a set of data points in space. 
Point clouds are generally produced by 3D scanners: LIDAR, Kinect, ...

**Approach Classification**
1. Pixel-based: Multi-view CNN(MVCNN)
2. Voxel-based: VoxNet, VRN Ensemble, ...
3. 3D point-based: PointNet

**Great article**
